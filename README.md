# CS166-Project
Database with ui for CS166 class at UCR

Initial Setup:
Modify the path locations in load_data.sql to point to the correct location. The directory for this file is under CS166_Project/sql/src. Should only need to change what comes before CS166_Project when editing the file. Also will need to fix the script located under CS166_Project/java/script to reflect the datbase name you are using along with the port and user name. Make sure the path is setup correctly in this file also.

Database must also have plpgsql installed. If the language is not installed please run createlang plpgsql at the database prompt.
